/** A Java 1.5 grammar for ANTLR v3 derived from the spec
 *
 *  This is a very close representation of the spec; the changes
 *  are comestic (remove left recursion) and also fixes (the spec
 *  isn't exactly perfect).  I have run this on the 1.4.2 source
 *  and some nasty looking enums from 1.5, but have not really
 *  tested for 1.5 compatibility.
 *
 *  I built this with: java -Xmx100M org.antlr.Tool java.g 
 *  and got two errors that are ok (for now):
 *  java.g:691:9: Decision can match input such as
 *    "'0'..'9'{'E', 'e'}{'+', '-'}'0'..'9'{'D', 'F', 'd', 'f'}"
 *    using multiple alternatives: 3, 4
 *  As a result, alternative(s) 4 were disabled for that input
 *  java.g:734:35: Decision can match input such as "{'$', 'A'..'Z',
 *    '_', 'a'..'z', '\u00C0'..'\u00D6', '\u00D8'..'\u00F6',
 *    '\u00F8'..'\u1FFF', '\u3040'..'\u318F', '\u3300'..'\u337F',
 *    '\u3400'..'\u3D2D', '\u4E00'..'\u9FFF', '\uF900'..'\uFAFF'}"
 *    using multiple alternatives: 1, 2
 *  As a result, alternative(s) 2 were disabled for that input
 *
 *  You can turn enum on/off as a keyword :)
 *
 *  Version 1.0 -- initial release July 5, 2006 (requires 3.0b2 or higher)
 *
 *  Primary author: Terence Parr, July 2006
 *
 *  Version 1.0.1 -- corrections by Koen Vanderkimpen & Marko van Dooren,
 *      October 25, 2006;
 *      fixed normalInterfaceDeclaration: now uses typeParameters instead
 *          of typeParameter (according to JLS, 3rd edition)
 *      fixed castExpression: no longer allows expression next to type
 *          (according to semantics in JLS, in contrast with syntax in JLS)
 *
 *  Version 1.0.2 -- Terence Parr, Nov 27, 2006
 *      java spec I built this from had some bizarre for-loop control.
 *          Looked weird and so I looked elsewhere...Yep, it's messed up.
 *          simplified.
 *
 *  Version 1.0.3 -- Chris Hogue, Feb 26, 2007
 *      Factored out an annotationName rule and used it in the annotation rule.
 *          Not sure why, but typeName wasn't recognizing references to inner
 *          annotations (e.g. @InterfaceName.InnerAnnotation())
 *      Factored out the elementValue section of an annotation reference.  Created 
 *          elementValuePair and elementValuePairs rules, then used them in the 
 *          annotation rule.  Allows it to recognize annotation references with 
 *          multiple, comma separated attributes.
 *      Updated elementValueArrayInitializer so that it allows multiple elements.
 *          (It was only allowing 0 or 1 element).
 *      Updated localVariableDeclaration to allow annotations.  Interestingly the JLS
 *          doesn't appear to indicate this is legal, but it does work as of at least
 *          JDK 1.5.0_06.
 *      Moved the Identifier portion of annotationTypeElementRest to annotationMethodRest.
 *          Because annotationConstantRest already references variableDeclarator which 
 *          has the Identifier portion in it, the parser would fail on constants in 
 *          annotation definitions because it expected two identifiers.  
 *      Added optional trailing ';' to the alternatives in annotationTypeElementRest.
 *          Wouldn't handle an inner interface that has a trailing ';'.
 *      Swapped the expression and type rule reference order in castExpression to 
 *          make it check for genericized casts first.  It was failing to recognize a
 *          statement like  "Class<Byte> TYPE = (Class<Byte>)...;" because it was seeing
 *          'Class<Byte' in the cast expression as a less than expression, then failing 
 *          on the '>'.
 *      Changed createdName to use typeArguments instead of nonWildcardTypeArguments.
 *          Again, JLS doesn't seem to allow this, but java.lang.Class has an example of
 *          of this construct.
 *      Changed the 'this' alternative in primary to allow 'identifierSuffix' rather than
 *          just 'arguments'.  The case it couldn't handle was a call to an explicit
 *          generic method invocation (e.g. this.<E>doSomething()).  Using identifierSuffix
 *          may be overly aggressive--perhaps should create a more constrained thisSuffix rule?
 *      
 *  Version 1.0.4 -- Hiroaki Nakamura, May 3, 2007
 *
 *  Fixed formalParameterDecls, localVariableDeclaration, forInit,
 *  and forVarControl to use variableModifier* not 'final'? (annotation)?
 *
 *  Version 1.0.5 -- Terence, June 21, 2007
 *  --a[i].foo didn't work. Fixed unaryExpression
 *
 *  Version 1.0.6 -- John Ridgway, March 17, 2008
 *      Made "assert" a switchable keyword like "enum".
 *      Fixed compilationUnit to disallow "annotation importDeclaration ...".
 *      Changed "Identifier ('.' Identifier)*" to "qualifiedName" in more 
 *          places.
 *      Changed modifier* and/or variableModifier* to classOrInterfaceModifiers,
 *          modifiers or variableModifiers, as appropriate.
 *      Renamed "bound" to "typeBound" to better match language in the JLS.
 *      Added "memberDeclaration" which rewrites to methodDeclaration or 
 *      fieldDeclaration and pulled type into memberDeclaration.  So we parse 
 *          type and then move on to decide whether we're dealing with a field
 *          or a method.
 *      Modified "constructorDeclaration" to use "constructorBody" instead of
 *          "methodBody".  constructorBody starts with explicitConstructorInvocation,
 *          then goes on to blockStatement*.  Pulling explicitConstructorInvocation
 *          out of expressions allowed me to simplify "primary".
 *      Changed variableDeclarator to simplify it.
 *      Changed type to use classOrInterfaceType, thus simplifying it; of course
 *          I then had to add classOrInterfaceType, but it is used in several 
 *          places.
 *      Fixed annotations, old version allowed "@X(y,z)", which is illegal.
 *      Added optional comma to end of "elementValueArrayInitializer"; as per JLS.
 *      Changed annotationTypeElementRest to use normalClassDeclaration and 
 *          normalInterfaceDeclaration rather than classDeclaration and 
 *          interfaceDeclaration, thus getting rid of a couple of grammar ambiguities.
 *      Split localVariableDeclaration into localVariableDeclarationStatement
 *          (includes the terminating semi-colon) and localVariableDeclaration.  
 *          This allowed me to use localVariableDeclaration in "forInit" clauses,
 *           simplifying them.
 *      Changed switchBlockStatementGroup to use multiple labels.  This adds an
 *          ambiguity, but if one uses appropriately greedy parsing it yields the
 *           parse that is closest to the meaning of the switch statement.
 *      Renamed "forVarControl" to "enhancedForControl" -- JLS language.
 *      Added semantic predicates to test for shift operations rather than other
 *          things.  Thus, for instance, the string "< <" will never be treated
 *          as a left-shift operator.
 *      In "creator" we rule out "nonWildcardTypeArguments" on arrayCreation, 
 *          which are illegal.
 *      Moved "nonWildcardTypeArguments into innerCreator.
 *      Removed 'super' superSuffix from explicitGenericInvocation, since that
 *          is only used in explicitConstructorInvocation at the beginning of a
 *           constructorBody.  (This is part of the simplification of expressions
 *           mentioned earlier.)
 *      Simplified primary (got rid of those things that are only used in
 *          explicitConstructorInvocation).
 *      Lexer -- removed "Exponent?" from FloatingPointLiteral choice 4, since it
 *          led to an ambiguity.
 *
 *      This grammar successfully parses every .java file in the JDK 1.5 source 
 *          tree (excluding those whose file names include '-', which are not
 *          valid Java compilation units).
 *
 *  Known remaining problems:
 *      "Letter" and "JavaIDDigit" are wrong.  The actual specification of
 *      "Letter" should be "a character for which the method
 *      Character.isJavaIdentifierStart(int) returns true."  A "Java 
 *      letter-or-digit is a character for which the method 
 *      Character.isJavaIdentifierPart(int) returns true."
